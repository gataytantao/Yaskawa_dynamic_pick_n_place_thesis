To use the project, we have named the files from a1_ to a8_ .py
These files, except a3_tof_arduino.py and a7_main_run.py, are connected mainly.
- a7_main_run.py is the first version we try to run threads from the another programs.
- a3_tof_arduino.py is the alternative for Jetson GPIO I2C program to read the laser proximity sensor.
- Another 4 files .py below is the adjustment files we used them for camera and robot calib and also TOF.
- On the GUI, we made use of the two figures of background and logo of Back Khoa University.
- The folder csv_files contains the TOF data raw and filtered -> support sketch the Matplotlib graph.
- The folder test_imgs contains some of the previous frames of background and objects we captured before. This made some helps.
